### @Bean:
```
In short, a Spring bean is an object which Spring framework manages
at runtime. A Spring bean is a basic building block of any Spring application.
Most of the Application logic code you write will be placed in Spring beans.

The management of a Spring bean includes:
* creating an object
* providing dependencies (e.g. other beans, configuration properties)
* intercepting object method calls to provide additional framework features
* destroying an object

```
